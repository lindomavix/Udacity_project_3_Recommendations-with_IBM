SUMMARY

The project contains the following tasks:

Exploratory Data Analysis: This part is for data exploration.

Rank Based Recommendations: To get started in building recommendations, I first find the most popular articles based on the most interactions. These are then the articles we might recommend to new users (or anyone depending on what we know about them).

User-User Based Collaborative Filtering: In order to build better recommendations for the users of IBM's platform, I look at users that are similar 

Matrix Factorization: Finally, I completed a machine learning approach to building recommendations. Using the user-item interactions, I built out a matrix decomposition. Using the decomposition, I got an idea of how well I can predict new articles an individual might interact with 

DATA
